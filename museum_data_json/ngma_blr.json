Painter, sculptor, graphic artist, designer, and art educationist, Ramachandran has explored diverse mediums and scales, with a dynamic personal vision and distinctive artistic style. Deeply influenced by the prevalent socio-political situation in Kerala, his early works represented oppression, violence, war, social imagery, re-enacting themes of exploitation, oppression, war, human brutality, and political violence. Human figures were dismembered, most of them headless. Several aspects of Indian classical art have been integrated into his art, including compound motifs and imagery, decorative elements along the exuberance of forms and colours. Ramachandran believes that his monumental painting 'Yayati' was one of the landmarks in his growth as an artist because it allowed him to incorporate elements of classical proportions and postures in his work. A decorative element much like the murals is observed in many of his paintings. However, in most of his works, the decorative element does not stand out; it is intrinsic, built into his figures' clothes and jewelry as a part of the overall design."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-12578-309/ngma_blr-acc-no-12578-309_01_h.jpg"}

One of the most intriguing \r\naspects of Samant's paintings is his use of texture: manipulation \r\nof paint materials with sand and glue in the early 1960's, paper \r\ncutouts attached to the canvas in the 1970's and the application \r\nof wire drawings in the 1980's."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-00801-401/ngma_blr-acc-no-00801-401_01_h.jpg"}

A versatile \r\nartist, Bhaskaran has painted a voluminous body of work, that \r\nincludes figurative and the abstract. His deliberately overlooks \r\nthis tradition and finds inspiration in the staid, though \r\nsymbolic, marriage photography displayed in most homes in India. \r\nMost well-known is Bhaskaran's signature work, the beloved 'cat' \r\nseries. Starting as a sketch of a wandering cat in his studio, \r\nthis interest soon developed into an obsession with the creature, \r\nthe feline animal becoming synonymous with the artist himself as \r\nmuch as the late M.F. Hussain was with his wild horses.\r\n\"My paintings will remind you of the elaborate facial makeup done \r\nby some African tribes.

As a significant component of \r\nthis huge public art campaign, Nandalal planned separate \r\npaintings which were later to become famous as 'Haripura posters' \r\ndepicting Indian life in all its variety. The charm and the \r\nplayful gaiety exuded by the linguistic \r\nfeatures blend perfectly well with the contents depicting \r\nsubjects like Hunters, Musicians, Bull Handlers, Carpenter, \r\nSmiths, Spinner, Husking women and modest scenes of rural life \r\nincluding animal rearing, child-nursing and cooking. The \r\nsimplicity of these works also lies in the unvarying use of the \r\npoint-cusped niche that frames the principal subject.\r\n\r\nHaripura posters celebrate the Indian rural life and culture \r\nsharing a vibrant earthy color palette and bold, energetic lines \r\nwith a vividly modernist graphic quality. A sweeping look at the \r\navailable images reveals that these posters draw attention to the \r\ndifferent activities, professions and trades that constellate the \r\nmoments of village daily life in a picturesque continuum. Most of \r\nthe imagery culled from his observed reality around were \r\ndeveloped from the rapid sketches Nandalal did during his survey \r\nof rural areas and people living near the location. The vigorous \r\ndynamic forms of certain figures of course cut across the frame \r\nthus saving the images from monotony. Created on handmade papers \r\nstretched on straw-board, these paintings or posters were \r\nexecuted with brilliant colors prepared and mixed from the local \r\nearth pigments. For Gandhi, art and Nandalal were synonymous and \r\nhe was proud and happy to have 'discovered' Nandalal as the \r\nartist of the Indian National Congress."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-04850-506/ngma_blr-acc-no-04850-506_01_h.jpg"}

Rejecting the \r\nguidelines laid down by European art as too formal and cold, Ali \r\nturned to the ancient art of folk painting in India for his \r\ninspiration. Gods and Kings, snakes and bulls, birds and cats \r\npeople his paintings and have come to be identified specifically \r\nwith Ali. He journeyed to Bastar to study the nuances of tribal \r\nculture and this experience enabled him to fine tune his \r\ntechnique and develop a style that came to be known as his own. \r\nAlthough any particular form of folk art does not influence his \r\nworks, Sultan Ali's canvases are deeply imbued by folk themes. \r\nAnimals and humans jostle for space on his canvases, sometimes \r\neven ending up inextricably mixed together."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-11841-356/ngma_blr-acc-no-11841-356_01_h.jpg"}

In particular, his work appropriates the distinctly Indian art form of hand-painted billboard hoardings, which until the advent of cheap commercial printing were widely used throughout India in advertising and political campaigns.

By doing so he aims to force the viewer to acknowledge the very people whom they routinely ignored in everyday life. Ghosh is fascinated by the huge scale of these billboards and how they seem to visually transform those depicted into something larger than life, into almost God-like beings - the use of scale metaphorically mirroring and enforcing existing social and class divides.

Sham Sunder", "Dimensions": "32 x 30 x 127 (H) cm", "Brief Description": "As an artist Sham Sunder has always believed that one should \r\nexperiment with new possibilities and innovate new expressions. He is \r\na figurative artist working in various mediums like wood, stone and \r\nwire mesh as a sculptor and also in painting and print making. The \r\nexternal physical manifestation of inner turmoil is essential for \r\nSham as figurative artist. He also displays a remarkable \r\nunderstanding of the risks inherent in easy reductionist approaches \r\nto issues like individual agony or social collapse. There are no \r\nsentimental outbursts. Each of his works is carefully executed, \r\nthough at the cost of a certain daring. Sham's works do not provoke \r\nhis viewers, instantly. They haunt them over a period of time. \r\n\r\nSham's works have emerged as reaction to human relationships, \r\nviolence in society and social evils that go in the name of \r\ncommunity, culture and tradition."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-14345-187/ngma_blr-acc-no-14345-187_01_h.jpg"}

This piece, called the 'Seven Faces of Dust,' once \r\nagain represents the transitory nature of all the things we long for, \r\nand of our momentary lives as well - it is to be effaced after the \r\nshowing, and the sand returned to the beach. \r\n\r\nReena also trained as a Bharatanatyam dancer for eight years, but as \r\nit turned out, painting was her calling and foremost love.

While her initial style was very similar to Abanindranath's, employing the wash technique to its fullest, her later paintings, reflected ideation arising from the encounter with village clay dolls that often adorned urban homes, and Kalighat pats.

Through the process of editing and applying these (fragments), he superimposes various facets of contemporary society. In fact, though formally trained as a painter, Shetty progressively became interested in sculpture and installation and began to combine his paintings with found objects that he painted. In 1996 he attended a sculpture workshop in Scotland that resulted in a spontaneous showing of swiftly executed watercolors; sketches in which the predominant leitmotif was that of a carrier bag embellished by whimsical images and memories of the surroundings. His art world reflects contemporary urban life. By stimulating the memories of people's childhood and their playful-mind filled with curiosity, he cleverly escapes from the globalism that homogenizes the world and innocently plots to overthrow the value system led by politics and the economy."}, "image_url": "https://www.museumsofindia.gov.in/repository/file/ngma_blr/ngma_blr-acc-no-16378-221/ngma_blr-acc-no-16378-221_01_h.jpg"}
